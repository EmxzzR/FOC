    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Emir Rash I am a 20 year old student at The university Of Belize, I am in persuing my associates degreee in 
    programing. Some things intersting about me is that I play and am in love in football, since I was 11 years old I have been 
    playing the beautiful game. I play LW(Left Wing) or as a CM(Center Attacking Midfielder). I am currently not on a team but 
    I have recently fallen in love with the sport ince again and I plan to play competitively once again. Another interesting 
    thing about me is that I am currently on a running team name Trail Blazers, it's quit nice running and to win races is also 
    a great experience, am just feeding my ego. Well thats a little about me and the end of this.....</p>
